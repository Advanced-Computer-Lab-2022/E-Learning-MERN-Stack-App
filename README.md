## To make things work out
Add anything needs to be fixed asap. <br />
Try to add tasks that other tasks depend on. <br />
Also add the date the task is published. <br />
Anything done write [X] in the above section. <br />
In commit message write "UPDATED README", so it can be easily tracked. <br />
