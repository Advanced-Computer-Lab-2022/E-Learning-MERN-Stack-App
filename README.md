# E-Learning
 An E-Learning web application using the MERN stack is a platform for delivering educational content to students over the internet. The e-learning web application will allow students to access course materials, complete quizzes and assessments, and track their progress through their studies. It will also provide instructors with tools to create and manage course content and track student progress. The application will be hosted on GitHub and can be accessed through a web browser.
  E-Learning is a place for Instructors & Course creators to benefit from their skills, we have all kinds of courses, you can learn how to cook, you can learn about Science, Math, and Programming!
  
## Motivation
Developing a MERN stack web application can be a rewarding and exciting project to undertake. Not only will you have the opportunity to build a fully functional web application from scratch, but you will also have the chance to work with some of the latest and most popular technologies in the industry. The MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js) provides a strong foundation for your web application, allowing you to focus on building a great user experience and innovative features. Additionally, learning and working with the MERN stack can open up new career opportunities and help you stay up-to-date with the constantly evolving world of web development. Overall, embarking on a MERN stack web application project is a fantastic way to challenge yourself, learn new skills, and create something truly impactful.
  
## Build Status
The web application is now complete. The application is stable and ready for deployment. All necessary features and functionality have been implemented and thoroughly tested. The application is built using the latest versions of MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, ensuring a solid foundation and excellent performance. Overall, the web application is in a fully finished state and ready for use.
  
## Code Style
The code style for this MERN stack web application follows the StandardJS style guide. This style guide promotes a consistent code style that is easy to read and understand. In addition to the StandardJS style guide, the following guidelines are also followed:

 - Use camelCase for variable names
 - Use PascalCase for component names
 - Place quotes around JSX attributes
 - Use semicolons at the end of statements

By adhering to these code style guidelines, we can ensure that the codebase is maintainable and easy to work with for all developers on the team.

## Technologies
The MERN stack is a popular stack for building web applications and consists of the following technologies:

-   **M**ongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing data in the form of JSON-like documents.
-   **E**xpress: A minimalist web framework for Node.js used for building the backend of web applications.
-   **R**eact: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-   **N**ode.js: A JavaScript runtime used for building the backend of web applications.

Together, these technologies form a full-stack solution for building web applications. In a MERN stack web application, MongoDB is used to store data, Express is used to build the backend, React is used to build the frontend, and Node.js is used to run the application.

## Features
Here are some potential features that are included in our E-Learning web application:
